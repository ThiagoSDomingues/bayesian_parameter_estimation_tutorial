- Example with "soft sector of heavy ion collision"
- Closure test (meaning that a model is used to generate the "data" for the Bayesian parameter estimation)
- Two observables
- Two parameters
- Simple "emulator": 2D linear interpolator
- Code written to be more easily generalised in higher dimensions
